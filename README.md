# Multiomics-analysis-AD-brain-plasticity-genes
Multi-omics analysis to assess if Alzheimer’s disease is associated with epigenetic dysregulation of plasticity-related genes and that such alterations may be reflected at the transcriptional level. 

This paper was made with the goal to get a foot in the door of epigenetic studies related to brainplastcity, whcih I would like to pursue.

My main gaols were to explore Microarray analysis and RNAseq analysis, as well as the use of LATEX.
